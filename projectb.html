  /*
  Small Project B
  Caesar Cipher
  Learning outcome: After completing this assignment, you will have learned how to process strings of text on a character-by-character level, how to extract characters from strings, how to concatenate strings, and how to convert characters to their ASCII codes and back.

  Broader impact: The concepts you will master through this small project are used, explicitly or implicitly, in all text processing applications.

  Programming concepts: for-loop, string, character, ASCII code, modular arithmetic; you may want to use charCodeAt() and fromCharCode().

  Task
  Create a web page with an embedded JavaScript program that implements Caesar cipher with a user-specified shift for the upper-case and lower-case English letters. The letters must wrap around.

  The user is shown a first prompt box and asked to enter a positive or negative integer representing the desired shift. For example, a left shift of 3 places would be represented as -3; a right shift of 1 place would be represented as 1.

  The user is shown a second prompt box, asking to enter the source (unencrypted) text.

  The user is shown an alert box with the encrypted text.

  In the encryption process, only letters A-Z and a-z are encoded; other characters must be left untouched.

  Sample input/output
  Your program: Enter shift
  User: -5
  Your program: Enter text
  User: Hello, world!
  Your program: Czggj, rjmgy!
  Note: The wording of the prompts “Enter shift” and “Enter text” is not prescribed, but the sequence of prompt boxes must follow the task description.

  Grading (5 points total)
  Your program is syntactically correct: 1 point.
  Your program follows formatting guidelines: 1 point.
  Your program correctly encodes strings that I supply: 3 points.


  1) Loop through string
  if A-Z: convert to ascii, shift it, get back in range, convert back to characters
  if a-z: same thing but with different ranges
