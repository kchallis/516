//This is a ridiculous example but it is the easiest example of recursion, and now we can look at stack overflow.
//When a function is called, JS needs to remember the caller so it knows where to go back after the function is done.
// The computer is fine with looking up several things in a row, but at some point, the dedicated
// and set aside for going back to the beginning, gets called so many times.
// "A very bad dictionary"
// How do you know where to return back to continue executing the rest of the code.
// Whatever you do with recursion you can do in a while loops
// Recursion is a nice tool in programming when used thoughtfully.
