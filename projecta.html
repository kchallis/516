Create a web page with an embedded JavaScript program that plays the “number guessing game” with the user as follows:

The user thinks of an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive).
The program needs to repeatedly take guesses at the number the user has in mind.
To each of the program’s guesses, the user responds “<” if the target number is less than the program’s guess; “>” if the target number is greater than the program’s guess; or “yes” if the program has guessed the number correctly. */
