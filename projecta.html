/*
    Task
    Create a web page with an embedded JavaScript program that plays the “number guessing game” with the user as follows:

    The user thinks of an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive).
    The program needs to repeatedly take guesses at the number the user has in mind.
    To each of the program’s guesses, the user responds “<” if the target number is less than the program’s guess; “>” if the target number is greater than the program’s guess; or “yes” if the program has guessed the number correctly.
    You need to come up with and implement the most efficient strategy for your program.

    Sample game
    Your program (prompt box): Is your number 23?
    User (enters into the prompt box): <
    Your program: Is your number 1?
    User: >
    Your program (prompt box): Is your number 14?
    User (enters into the prompt box): yes
    Your program (alert box): I won!
